# packet-delivery-time-estimator
A web-based tool to estimate the delivery time of a data packet in a network. Users can input distance, packet size, bandwidth, and delay to get the estimated transmission time.
Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript – for creating the input forms and displaying results.

Backend: Python Flask – for handling requests, calculations, and serving web pages.

Database: None (all calculations are done in real-time; no data storage required).

Tools & Libraries: Python 3.11, Flask.

**#Future Enhancements**

Add support for real-time network simulation using live data or APIs.

Include graphical visualizations of packet travel times for better understanding.

Allow users to save calculation history for future reference.

Incorporate multiple network paths to compare delivery times between routes.

Integrate advanced network parameters like jitter, packet loss, and congestion.

Make a mobile-friendly version for accessibility on smartphones and tablets.
